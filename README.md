# Zambs-Brunetto Puzzle Collection

This is a Flutter implementation for the puzzles presented on [Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/).

Each puzzle is implemented in it's own self-contained package that will be imported by the [puzzle_aggregator](packages/puzzle_aggregator) package.

## Running

You can play all the puzzles by running the [puzzle_aggregator](packages/puzzle_aggregator) package.

If you want to play a specific puzzle only you can [create an example app](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages) for the specific package and import it.
